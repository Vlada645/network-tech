    <h1>Report: ISO/OSI Model and Protocol Assignment</h1>
    <p>This report provides a theoretical description of the ISO/OSI model, its Protocol Data Units (PDUs), and the assignment of various network protocols to its corresponding layers.</p>

    <h2>1. Theoretical Description</h2>
    <h2>1.1. Description of ISO/OSI Model and Protocol Assignment</h2>
      <p>
        The <b>Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model</b> is a conceptual framework created by the <b>International Organization for Standardization (ISO)</b>. 
        It describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network. It's the first standard model for network communications, adopted by all major computer and telecommunication companies. 
        The model is a conceptual tool for understanding and designing networking architectures, 
        defining how applications running on different systems can communicate with each other.
        <br><br>
        The seven layers of the OSI model, from top to bottom, are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Application Layer (Layer 7):</b> The layer closest to the end user. It provides the interface between the applications and the network. It's responsible for interacting with software applications that implement a communicating component.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Presentation Layer (Layer 6):</b> Responsible for translating, encrypting, and compressing data. It ensures that the data is in a readable format for the Application Layer of the receiving system.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Session Layer (Layer 5):</b> Establishes, manages, and terminates the connections (sessions) between local and remote applications. It handles coordination and synchronization of the dialogue.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Transport Layer (Layer 4):</b> Responsible for end-to-end communication between the source and destination hosts. It ensures complete data transfer. It segments data and reassembles it into a data stream. It offers connection-oriented (<b>TCP</b>) or connectionless (<b>UDP</b>) services.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Network Layer (Layer 3):</b> Responsible for routing and logical addressing. It determines the best path for data to travel across interconnected networks. Protocols at this layer handle the logical addressing (e.g.,<b>IP addresses</b>).
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Data Link Layer (Layer 2):</b> Provides node-to-node data transfer and detects/potentially corrects errors that may occur at the Physical Layer. It's divided into two sublayers: the <b>Logical Link Control (LLC)</b> and the <b>Media Access Control (MAC)</b>. Protocols at this layer handle physical addressing (e.g., <b>MAC addresses</b>).
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Physical Layer (Layer 1):</b> Responsible for the physical transmission medium (e.g., cables, radio waves) and the electrical/optical/radio signaling. It converts the data bits into a signal and transmits them over the network medium.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <hr>
      <h2>1.2. Protocol Data Units (PDUs) for Corresponding Layers</h2>
      <p>
        A <b>Protocol Data Unit (PDU)</b> is a single unit of information transmitted over a network. It represents the data payload at different stages of the communication process, often changing name as it moves through the layers.
      </p>
